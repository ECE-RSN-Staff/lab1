    "# EECE 5554 Lab 1: GNSS Drivers and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab 1 introduces several concepts that are critical to sensing and navigation in robotics. You will use a GNSS receiver to collect latitude and longitude data, convert latitude and longitude to UTM zone and letter, and publish this information in a custom ROS message. You will also analyze walking and stationary data that you collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, we expect that a well-prepared student will be able to: \n",
    "- Write a Python program to parse data read over USB serial \n",
    "- Convert latitude and longitude to UTM using the UTM package\n",
    "- Define a custom ROS message \n",
    "- Publish a custom message using a ROS publisher node\n",
    "- Save data using a .bag file \n",
    "- Select and apply appropriate statistical analysis types to easting and northing data\n",
    "- Analyze data using appropriate statistical and plotting tools in Python\n",
    "- Discuss results and appropriately identify sources of error in data sets\n",
    "- Generate professional figures with axis labels and units\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information of Note\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware: \n",
    "- GPS puck (provided by course)\n",
    "- Laptop with sufficient battery life for at least one 10 minute data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software:\n",
    "- Working Ubuntu from Lab 0\n",
    "- Working ROS installation from Lab 0\n",
    "- A serial emulator called Minicom: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom. Get it using <code> sudo apt install minicom </code>\n",
    "- Turbo87's package for converting between lat/long and UTM: https://github.com/Turbo87/utm . Get it using <code> pip3 install utm</code>\n",
    "- The course sensor emulator. Get it using <code> git clone https://github.com/ECE-RSN-Staff/sensor_emulator </code>\n",
    "- The course Lab 1 autograder and examples. Get them using <code> git clone https://github.com/ECE-RSN-Staff/lab_1 </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The GNSS driver:\n",
    "During this lab, you will write a driver that:\n",
    "- Reads the string the GNSS puck outputs from the serial port\n",
    "- Breaks this string into useful information (latitude, longitude, etc.)\n",
    "- Converts the string to specified ROS formats for lat, lon, UTM easting, and UTM northing\n",
    "- Merges the information into a custom message\n",
    "- Publishes the message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual and team work: \n",
    "Individual work: Write your own device driver for data acquisition and collect datasets. <br>\n",
    "Team work: Share the GPS based GNSS puck after you have tested with the emulator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sets: \n",
    "- One 10 minute .bag with stationary data in an open area (e.g., no trees or buildings within 10 m)\n",
    "- One 10 minute .bag with stationary data in an occluded area (e.g., trees or buildings nearby)\n",
    "- One .bag recording as you walk approximately 200 m in a straight line. Ideally, this dataset will include occluded and open areas, but anything is OK. \n",

    "### Repository structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to follow the naming convention laid out here to have an appropriate structure that can be checked by the Lab 1 autograder and to receive credit for your work. Please make sure you are following these conventions **exactly**-- spaces and capitalization matter!\n",
